<b>Components</b>
The Excalidraw User Interface (UI) can conveniently be divided into different sections to create a clone. Here's a list of the various sections we will consider when breaking down the entire clone into components:

1.A menu which has basic shapes like Square, Rectangle, Triangle and Circle. User can select and shape from the menu and finally the user is able to draw the shapes on the canvas

2.Undo/Redo functionality: Keep a history of all actions taken by the user You can refer to the code below to track the history of all the actions taken by the user 3.Selection and Transformation: First, we need to keep track of all shapes drawn on the canvas and then, we need to detect if the user clicks on a shape
